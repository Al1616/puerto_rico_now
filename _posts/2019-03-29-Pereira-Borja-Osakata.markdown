	Sancocho, a caribbean stew composed of root vegetables and scraps of meat. I call it a stew of resilience. For when the slaves were brought and forced to work the fields, you would find a pot of this stew simmering on the fire all day as the workers tended the crops. It was always made with what was left. Leftover beef or pork scraps, yucca, plantains, squashes and more. It needed to cook all day to break down the tough pieces of meat. In what may have been adapted as peasant food, was a heart, nutritious and filling meal that gave workers the fuel their bodies needed. Sancocho. For even when hurricanes will flood and yank the trees from their roots, you can find carrots and yucca hidden in the soil. Once ripen, they wait to be pulled out from the earth, and into you. Sancocho. They say the Spanish brought over the original version that was made with fish but, you cannot deny the hearty influence of Taíno and African cultures. Yucca from the Taínos and platanos from the Africans. All three simmered giving birth to the Puerto Ricans who have reclaimed the sancocho and its meaning to their lives. Sancocho, a dish that does not cost much to make but can feed many. Chances are you’ll find it at welcome parties, birthday parties, dinner parties, community events, and sometimes even after a brutal storm. <br><br>There was a time when you could everything you needed to make a large pot of sancocho was available on your land.</p>
