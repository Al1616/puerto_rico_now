	<p>
	Sancocho, a caribbean stew composed of root vegetables and scraps of meat. I call it a stew of resilience. For when the slaves were brought and forced to work the fields, you would find a pot of this stew simmering on the fire all day as the workers tended the crops. It was always made with what was left. Leftover beef or pork scraps, yucca, plantains, squashes and more. It needed to cook all day to break down the tough pieces of meat. In what may have been adapted as peasant food, was a heart, nutritious and filling meal that gave workers the fuel their bodies needed. Sancocho. For even when hurricanes will flood and yank the trees from their roots, you can find carrots and yucca hidden in the soil. Once ripen, they wait to be pulled out from the earth, and into you. Sancocho. They say the Spanish brought over the original version that was made with fish but, you cannot deny the hearty influence of Taíno and African cultures. Yucca from the Taínos and platanos from the Africans. All three simmered giving birth to the Puerto Ricans who have reclaimed the sancocho and its meaning to their lives. Sancocho, a dish that does not cost much to make but can feed many. Chances are you’ll find it at welcome parties, birthday parties, dinner parties, community events, and sometimes even after a brutal storm. <br><br>There was a time when you could everything you needed to make a large pot of sancocho was available on your land.</p><br><br>

<p>“Food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. It puts the aspirations and needs of those who produce, distribute and consume food at the heart of food systems and policies rather than the demands of markets and corporations.” – Declaration of Nyéléni, the first global forum on food sovereignty, Mali, 2007</p>

<p>Agroecology farming is a key component in Food Sovereignty. An alternative model to current industrial farming, where small farmers Agroecology is concerned with where food comes from, how it is produced, who produces it and how knowledge and skills around food and agriculture are shared. It accompanies this understanding of food and agricultural production with a social, cultural and political context – drawing a picture of our different agricultures, and celebrating their diversity. It provides a holistic understanding of our place in natural cycles and how our farming systems must adapt to and enhance the ecosystems and societies they depend on.</p>
