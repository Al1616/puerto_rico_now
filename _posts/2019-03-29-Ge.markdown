Hurricanes Irma and Maria struck the island of Puerto Rico at a time when its infrastructure and emergency systems lagged behind those elsewhere in the rest of the Caribbean and the United States. The impoverishment of the island is nothing new, though the storm has certainly aggravated the state of poverty, pushing 100% of the island’s power grid past its breaking point and causing additional damage to neglected structures and infrastructures. In part due to Puerto Rico’s unpayable debt circumstances, many financial institutions have chosen to foreclose damaged properties in hopes of turning a profit as developers eye the region, slowing recovery. Migration due to the aforementioned factors of debt and land disenfranchisement have impeded recovery efforts, furthering the push of inhabitants off the island as structures go unrepaired. At 9.8%, Puerto Rico has an unemployment rate that more than doubles the current national unemployment rate (United States Department of Labor, n.d.), and legally unrestricted migration to the United States further encourages inhabitants to leave. An estimated 140,000 residents have left in the past year (U.S. Census Bureau, 2018), though some place that estimate significantly higher. 


Puerto Rico’s existing crisis, further intensified by the damage left behind by the storms, have led many opportunistic speculators to eye the island as a tabula rasa with an undetermined future. As such, we believe it is crucial to study what life may look like for the residents of Puerto Rico under these potential changes. 


[This webpage](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) provides a comprehensive guide to markdown syntax. But to make things easier for you we are including a cheat sheet of the main things you need to know here.

#### Please use level 4 headings for major section divisions

Write **words in bold** like this.

Italics are *similar* and are formatted like this.

To make a paragraph break you need to add two spaces at the end of your line before going to the next line.

See this is now a new paragraph.

Lists are easy:
1. they can be ordered
1. like this
1. notice that the numbers are automatically ordered
  1. use two spaces in front to indent

Or they can just be bullet points:
- like this
* or like this
  - use two spaces
  - to have nested lists

Use Author-Date parenthetical citations following Chicago Manual of Style conventions throughout your document, and add a works cited at the bottom of your post. See Author-Date quick guide [here](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html) for citation conventions.

To include hyperlinks format them like this [text of link](http://c4sr.columbia.edu/).

To embed images first ensure that the file is at least 740px wide. Then place the image file in a folder named for your group in the images folder. Then link to that image using the format here, but replace the file path with the name of your group's folder and appropriate image file name:

![description of image](/puerto_rico_now/images/groupname/test2-.png)

If you want to include html files (i.e. an interactive map) host these via your personal github page, and then you can embed them in your document with a iframe. The format looks like this:

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/290575503?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

All you need to do to use one is replace the url that is between the two " ". Here is an iframe of mapbox tiles:


<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoibWFwYm94IiwiYSI6ImNpejY4NDg1bDA1cjYzM280NHJ5NzlvNDMifQ.d6e-nNyBDtmQCVwVNivz7A#2/0/0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>
