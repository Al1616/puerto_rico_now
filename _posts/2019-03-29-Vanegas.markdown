**Brief**  

Puerto Rico’s existing crisis, further intensified by the damage left behind by the storms, have led many opportunistic speculators to eye the island as a tabula rasa with an undetermined future. As such, we believe it is crucial to study what life may look like for the residents of Puerto Rico under these potential changes.  

**Popular Predictions for the Future of Puerto Rico**

1. *Tourist Paradise*: Given Puerto Rico’s financial crisis, developers have eyed Puerto Rico as the ultimate Caribbean vacation spot for domestic and international tourists. This development would likely focus around coastal areas and San Juan, with little focus on the interior. Potential stumbling blocks to this operation include local opposition and a potential federal minimum wage increase currently being debated by Congress, which, if passed, would more than double the current minimum wage and significantly raise operations costs.
1. *The Singapore of the Caribbean*: Inspired by the tiger economy that catapulted Singapore to the forefront of Southeast Asian quality of life figures, some economists have speculated that intensive economic development may be possible as the island recovers. Neglecting that the Singaporean and similar economies that experienced such a boom did so after achieving a significant degree of autonomy, this plan would involve investing in industries which existing residents could work in, along with rigorous job training programs.
1. *Islandwide Land Trust*: Taking inspiration from the community of Caño Martín Peña, this idea extrapolates what would happen if similar land trusts were to be established in other parts of Puerto Rico. Land trusts in the 8 neighborhoods that comprise Caño Martín Peña allow for collective ownership of households, which has inspired communities such as Rio Piedras to follow suit. This plan requires existing landowners to establish trusts that would then seek to take advantage of the current Puerto Rican land market to purchase abandoned properties for the development of affordable housing and services (Nonprofit Quarterly, 2018).
