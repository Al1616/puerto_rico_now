#### **Reconstruction is Underway**
  
Puerto Rico is in a state of serious change. Over a year since the devastation of Hurricanes Maria and Irma, federal disaster aid continues to be withheld by Congress, forcing recovery efforts to continue unaided by the federal government. Prior to the storms making landfall in November 2017, residents of the island had already been feeling the effects of rising unemployment, crippling debt, and exploitative development practices for several decades. In addition to the loss of over 3,000 lives, the destruction left in the wake of these storms pushed much of the island’s infrastructure and resources past capacity. For many, this disaster has been the final motivator to leave Puerto Rico. Those who remain will be the first to bear witness to dramatic changes as reconstruction properly begins.
  
  
  
#### **In February of 2019, Congress Approved $1.5 Billion in Relief Aid**
  
To understand what these changes may be and how Puerto Rico will be transformed, our research team began an initial investigation into the island’s ongoing demographic and economic shifts within a historical context to answer four questions:
  
  - Who stands to profit and who stands to suffer from reconstruction efforts?
  - Which areas are going to see the greatest change?
  - How are these areas going to be redeveloped, and at what cost?
  - What are the alternatives to our prediction?
  
  
#### **That Same Year, Puerto Rico Reported a Record-Breaking 1.7 Million Tourists in 2018**
  
Though it is impossible to know the future, our team has identified multiple directions in which Puerto Rico may be headed using this data. Without loss of generality, we chose to develop and focus on two hypothetical future scenarios that favor the interests of individuals on opposite ends of a spectrum of figures who wish to see Puerto Rico prosper in different ways. In doing so, we hope to provide a specific picture of what is possible in the near future, as well as to highlight the dangerous processes underway in Puerto Rico at the present moment. 
  
  
#### **Two Scenarios: A Business-Class Tourist Paradise, or an Island for the People?**
  
![concept photo](/puerto_rico_now/images/future_scenarios/concept_photo.jpg)
  
On one end of this spectrum lie developers, investors, politicians, and citizens who view Puerto Rico as a potential tourist haven, corporate tax shelter, or both. Such individuals benefit from economic incentives to develop Puerto Rico using American capital. On the other end of the spectrum lie Puerto Ricans who draw inspiration from a rich history of collective community organization to envision an island free of the extraction practices inherent to the colony. Such a Puerto Rico is organized into collective land trusts, has a diverse economy focused on local production and reinvestment into municipalities, and engages directly with global actors. 

We understand, of course, that these are two extremes on a broad spectrum that includes individuals and groups with aligned, conflicting, and often competing interests. Yet in examining the ideology behind opposite ends of this spectrum and proposing our own radical future for the island tailored to each, we hope to reach a richer picture of where Puerto Rico is heading, how many of the factors contributing to change were already in place before the recent natural disaster, and what is being done currently to effect changes that, inevitably, will leave some better off and others deeply unsatisfied. 
  
  
  
#### **Exploitation and Extraction: a Scenario for Predatory Development**
  
Puerto Rico has long been a source for wealth extraction under colonial powers from Spain to the United States. Though legally classified as an unincorporated territory of the United States, Puerto Rico remains subject to exploitative laws that continue to profit American venture capitalists, developers, and investors. The business ventures of these figures often generate profits without providing significant job growth or tax revenue to the island. 
  
  
#### **An Existing Legal Framework Incentivises Exploitative Development**
  
Our first scenario imagines a future in which such figures have developed Puerto Rico into a lucrative enterprise that operates with few local employees and is exempt from significant municipal, territorial, and federal taxes. Tourism--already a major part of Puerto Rico’s economy--has become the dominant industry on the island, providing luxury as well as discount services to tourists of all classes. Tax-sheltered business developments employ a small percentage of Puerto Ricans with sufficient education and wealth to make a relatively easy transition into the tech and finance sectors. Were such a scenario to be realized, we predict the greatest developments and their immediate consequences would most likely occur in the areas shown in the map below.
  
**Tourism Scenario**

#### PART I-Predatory Exploitative Development Scenario

Presentation of the development practices of American venture capitalists. Explanation of the legal framework in place to encourage this kind of development and government support for extraction. Segue into a decision map which shows the areas most likely to be developed if this model of predatory development continues. Make significant note of the difficulty of interpreting government datasets.

Economic index-map/explanation of motives to develop in which areas
Analysis of this scenario as the natural continuation of existing practices. This is the existing model of colonial extraction of wealth from Puerto Rico for a very small percentage of American venture capitalists. Without an adequate intervention, Puerto Rico’s future will include more of these kinds of developments, turning the island into a haven for tourists and financial moguls and pushing out the remaining population or shackling them under ever greater inequality.


#### **PART II-A (potential) Adequate Intervention: Land Trust/Collective Scenario**

Discussion that Puerto Rico does not, however, have to follow this narrative. Consider that Congress has appropriated $18.5 billion in hurricane relief aid, (a previous $1.5 billion was approved for spending back in February, and so is not included in our analysis). Additionally, y percent of Puerto Rican debt has been argued to be unconstitutional. Let us suppose three things:
Congress approves the spending of the $18.5 billion allocated for disaster relief
X billion dollars of Puerto Rico’s $74 billion debt is ruled unconstitutional, meaning that it would not need to be repaid to the owners of this debt.
Puerto Rican lawmakers are allowed to spend this total sum of Y billion dollars as they see fit.
Interactive Data Visualization that shows three policies--change of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds, jobs creation program to change unemployment, and change in weekly wages via a financial incentive for employers.
Presentation of several micro-scenarios:
Increased Spending on Healthcare
Subsidization of partnerships, small businesses, and farm collectives
Increased Spending on Education
Others, as desired, or a combination of the above
Remarks on the specific policies included in the visualization, and additional changes that would need to occur to make the micro-scenarios possible. Push beyond the obvious conclusions; a look at unintended consequences, a discussion of autonomy, a push at what happens next, or some additional analysis can occur here. 


#### PART III-CONCLUSION AND MANIFESTO
We’ve presented two very different scenarios of what Puerto Rico’s future might look like. One that involves a continuation of the predatory development that profits a small portion of Puerto Ricans. The other directs funds to social spending measures that most benefits the population of Puerto Rico neglected by its government and hurt by unscrupulous development practices. Why did we do this, what does it say, what final conclusions can or cannot be drawn?
