#### Project Proposal

Our primary objective in researching the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico is, in a sense, to reframe it as the *revelation* of infrastructural issues confronting, not only the island’s recovery, but its growth and resilience. Inefficient electrical grids, hierarchical road maintenance, rising rates of residential vacancy, and contaminated water systems are not a result of the hurricane’s impact, but have rather been brought to light on account of it.  

A single entity, PREPA, has been the island’s **sole proprietor of energy** - from coal, petroleum, and renewables alike - for over 70 years. Their plant distribution line’s inequitable structure, at the very least, seems a primary reason for the island’s extensive, and expansive, power outages after the storm. The grid is not structured by station proximity or production volume to demand. It isn't structured around relationships between generation costs and socioeconomic distribution on the island. It wasn't planned as an efficient connection network, as successful transportation systems are. The grid's success is that it brings power from the most reliable stations to San Juan, regardless of the needs of the town next door or those on its path. The result is outdated distribution lines running across the island in highly vulnerable, long, weaving paths - which then take longer to assess, access, repair, or replace.  

In 2010, Puerto Rico passed legislation requiring PREPA to reach a sequence of renewable energy goals: 12% by 2015, 15% by 2020, and 20% by 2035. In the 2016-2017 fiscal year, **only 2%** of the island's energy came from renewable sources - on an island surrounded by waves, in the sunny tropics, with seasonally high winds. Since Hurricane Maria, multiple non-profits and small businesses have rallied for solar energy restructuring on the island, beginning implementation as both individual, battery-storage cell units and microgrids. The American Red Cross, water pump stations, public schools, Verdifica - and the list goes on - are all a part of these installations and ground-roots movements. The switch to solar power is two-fold: it provides relief from the island's dependency on PREPA, while utilizing the urgency of recovery to forcefully bring renewable energy to Puerto Rico’s future. A 2018 Clean Energy Bill proposed new goals: 25% renewable sources by 2025 and 100% by 2050.  

While the emptying of Puerto Rico may seem to be a recent discussion, revolving around a lack of assistance and aid after Hurricane Maria, a 2018 study observed vacancy rates rising more or less consistently in the decade leading up to 2016 - with the island's highest rate of vacancy occurring in San Juan, which, perhaps ironically, is now considered to be the entire island’s future. We question how the concentration of aid and resources to Puerto Rico’s urban centres, primarily San Juan, are redistributing the island’s population - or relocating it to the continent. The hurricane and its recovery process are acting on deeply rooted underlying issues, creating an environment in which action, policy, and activism are all rushing to respond, each hoping to establish *their* infrastructure as dominant on the more-or-less blank slate of Puerto Rico.  
 
Within the overlaps of existing and emerging infrastructural systems - what is revealed which might or might not be expected? Are solar panel installations highest in regions regions poorly serviced by PREPA’s existing grid? Are they along the most accessible roads? Do they align with regions of low or high socioeconomic power? Is there an association with vacancy rates? Are the water pump stations, recently equipped with solar panels, servicing regions most affected by contaminated water distribution pre-Maria, or are there other factors that come to light by overlapping the data?  

We find it interesting that the majority of data found (thus far) is once-removed from its source topic. For example, understanding vacancy as a result of Post Office Change of Address logs, or mobile cell-phone data; road repair via crowdsourced data collection or satellite-monitored traffic patterns. We believe that navigating these associations will prove the biggest struggle in our project, discovering ways to creatively trace the data we seek which ensures the trustworthiness of our overlaid findings.
