#### Introduction 

Puerto Rico, a once-agricultural nation-state, needed to import **85% of its food** in 2018. This figure left the country extremely vulnerable post-Hurricane Maria. 
*Understanding this*, we will be looking at how the countryâ€™s food system has changed over the last decade. Our focus will be the mobilization of agricultural organizations post-Hurricane Maria. The study will highlight engineered deficiencies of food systems that were caused by the industrialization of the island and aims to provide insight into areas in which local agricultural organizations can intervene to create food sovereignty and social resilience.
