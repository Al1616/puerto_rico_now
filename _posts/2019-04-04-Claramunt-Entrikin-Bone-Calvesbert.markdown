####Question: To what extent are municipalities capable of recovering in Puerto Rico?

This project develops a decision model based in *social* and *physical* vulnerability metrics that are first mapped individually and secondly added into one final model to render a map showing the capacity of municipalities to recover from socio-natural disasters and climate events.
The social vulnerability indicators will be based on demographic and socioeconomic factors, including the change in populations related to migration post Hurricanes. 

**The Physical vulnerability index** will consider environmental conditions and impact in housing stock by using existent and new datasets. The analysis will consider “municipios” as a primary legal division of Puerto Rico. An existent **social vulnerability index (SVI)** for Puerto Rico developed in 2017 will be revised, but as it is based on census tracts is not transferable to our study. This difference is
relevant because municipios are in charge of implementing and coordinating local government actions being a key player in the provision of services and resilience of communities.  

The following proxies will be considered to measure social vulnerability and physical vulnerability, generating a decision model to map the municipalities by scores in each index.

####Social Vulnerability Indicator (SVI):
Population Demographics  
- Age (under 18- over 65)
- Income (% in poverty by individual)
- Employment (% Unemployed)
- Single parent household
Migration
- pop gain and loss
Debt (by Municipality)
- Annual debt by municipality

####Physical Vulnerability Indicator (PVI):
Environmental
- Satellite Images (deforestation)
- Landslide Impact
- Flood zone
Housing Stock
- Housing Units Destroyed (Fema Individual Assistance Data)
- Satellite Images (measure % of blue tarps and change in time)
